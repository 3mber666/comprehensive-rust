# Exercises

There are two exercises for Webassembly, they both live in their own repository inside of
[rust-wasm-template](../rust-wasm-template).

- [The Camera Exercise](camera.md) will give you access to the camera on your computer and offer you to
  apply transformations on the frames it captures.
- [The Game Of Life Exercise](game-of-life.md) will have you implement _John Conway's Game Of Life_ using Webassembly.

You can find the solutions here:

- [Camera](solutions-camera.md)
- [Game Of Life](solutions-game-of-life.md)
